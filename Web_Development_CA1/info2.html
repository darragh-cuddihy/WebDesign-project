        <h3>Apple production would decrease significantly, making them a luxury item.
          Dairy cows would struggle to find food, leading to a shortage of dairy products such as milk, cheese, yogurt, and ice cream.
          <br>
          Wild animals that rely on bee-pollinated plants for food would struggle to survive, leading to a decline in biodiversity.
          <br>
          Medicines derived from flowering plants, such as aspirin and morphine, would become scarce and expensive.
          <br>
          Vegetable oil production would collapse, as oilseed rape crops are heavily reliant on bee pollination.
          <br>
          Broccoli, carrots, pumpkins, and other squash-type vegetables would become difficult to produce, leading to a decrease in their availability andaffordability.
          Honey would no longer be produced, causing a loss of a healthy and natural food product.
          <br>
          Beeswax, which is used in various cosmetics and skincare products, would become scarce and valuable.
          Plants that rely on bees for pollination would gradually disappear, leading to a decline in ecosystems and biodiversity.
          Dependent organisms, such as bee-eater birds, would struggle to find food and may face extinction.
          Cereal grains, which are wind-pollinated, would become the primary source of human sustenance, leading to a shift in diet and agricultural practices.Food prices would skyrocket due to the lack of pollinators, leading to economic instability.
          Hand-pollination or robotic pollination would become necessary for certain crops, increasing labor costs and decreasing efficiency.
          Clothing made from cotton, which relies on bee pollination, would become more expensive and less accessible.
          Almonds, which are entirely dependent on bees for pollination, would become a rare and expensive commodity.
          Other nuts, such as Brazil nuts and macadamia nuts, would also become scarce and expensive due to their reliance on bee pollination.</h3>
